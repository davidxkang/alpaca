                        (i) Customer agrees that domestic and international carriage by Alpaca of any shipments tendered to Alpaca using ALPACA shall be in accordance with the terms, conditions and limitations of liability set out on the NONNEGOTIABLE Air Waybill, Label, Manifest, or Pick-Up Record (collectively "Shipping Documentation") and as appropriate any transportation agreement between Customer and Alpaca covering such shipment and in any applicable tariff, Service Guide or Standard Conditions of Carriage, copies of which are available upon request, and which are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. If there is a conflict between the Shipping Documentation and any such document then in effect or this Agreement, the transportation agreement, tariff, Service Guide, Standard Conditions of Carriage, or this Agreement will control, in that order of priority. If a shipment originates outside the United States, the contract of carriage is with the Alpaca subsidiary, branch, or independent contractor who originally accepts the shipment.

Customer will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Alpaca, its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all losses, damages, claims and other items of cost and expense arising out of Customer's failure to apply the international carriage terms to the Shipping Documentation for such international shipments, including without limitation claims from the recipient of any shipment, and Customer's failure to follow Alpaca's instructions in regard to the placement of the terms on the Shipping Documentation for such international shipments.
                         
                        (iii) Printed Signature. Customer acknowledges that if ALPACA is used to process shipments to locations outside the United States or country of shipment origin, Customer must enter the name of the person completing the Shipping Documentation to print in lieu of its manual signature on the Shipping Documentation, as applicable, for all shipments tendered by Customer to Alpaca using ALPACA. Customer further acknowledges that such printed name shall be sufficient to constitute the Customer's signature, and Customer's acceptance of Alpaca's terms and conditions of carriage contained in the applicable transportation agreement, tariff, Service Guide, Standard Conditions, or Shipping Documentation, under which the shipment is accepted by Alpaca, or its independent contractor.
                         
                        (iv) Unless otherwise indicated, the shipper's address indicated on the face of any Shipping Documentation is the place of execution and the place of departure and the recipient's address listed on the face of the Shipping Documentation is the place of destination. Unless otherwise indicated on the face of the Shipping Documentation the first carrier of all shipments is Alpaca Express, P.O. Box 727, Memphis, TN 38194. The address for Alpaca Ground is P.O. Box 108, Coraopolis, PA 15230.
